# cryptools

This is some cryptographic function, adapted by myself with aim to crypt plain data.
Maybe later i would work on rawdata encryption with some better algoritmh but i'm currently trying to build a large bank of old algoritmh
Please don't use in critical systeme because I know my code could be easly broken :).
